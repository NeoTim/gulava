***Updating JavaDoc***
If you re-generate the documentation, only commit it if you are sure that the MIME Types are set correctly.
This is done by enabling SVN Auto-Properties, by editing your ~/.subversion/config file, such that it contains the following lines:

enable-auto-props = yes
[auto-props]
*.txt = svn:mime-type=text/plain
*.html = svn:mime-type=text/html
*.css = svn:mime-type=text/css
*.png = svn:mime-type=image/png
*.jpg = svn:mime-type=image/jpeg
*.svg = svn:mime-type=image/svg+xml
*.gif = svn:mime-type=image/gif

This is important because the website links to Javadoc within the SVN repository, and the links will all look like text (as opposed to rendered HTML) if the mime types are wrong.

***Releasing a New Version***
This project uses Semantic Versioning. See VERSION.

To build and commit the new artifacts, first commit updated javadocs:
// TODO improve this
rm -r docs
mvn clean javadoc:jar
mv target/apidocs docs
svn commit -m "javadoc"

Then upload to the Maven repo, as per:
http://nexus.sonatype.org/oss-repository-hosting.html

And finally, update the Maven coordinates on the google code page, and upload the new jars.
