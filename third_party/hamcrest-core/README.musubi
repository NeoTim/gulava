Version: 36d525e1e425006939a77aec5183aecd7c775b05 (1.3)

Notes:
- Only includes the src/main/java directory of the
  actual Git repository.
- Copied LICENSE.txt file to hamcrest-core/LICENSE
- This is an old version of Hamcrest which is required by Junit4
- Manually copied in CoreMatchers.java from a later version:
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hamcrest/JavaHamcrest/89b17d8f3c020a3ba94c60328eee9c368289bbb5/hamcrest-core/src/main/java/org/hamcrest/CoreMatchers.java
  And deleted some methods to fix compiler errors. This file was auto-generated
  in v1.3 but I couldn't find the logic to do that locally.
